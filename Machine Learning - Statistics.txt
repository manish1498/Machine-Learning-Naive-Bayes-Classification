Machine Learning   - Statistics  

It requires understanding Bayesian thinking. 
*Bayesian thinking* is the process of updating beliefs as additional data is collected, and it's the engine behind many machine learning models.
Key concepts include conditional probability, priors and posteriors, and maximum likelihood.

#### Here are the 3 steps to learning the statistics and probability required for data science:
Step - 1 - Core Statistics Concepts
Descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression.
Step - 2 - Bayesian Thinking
Conditional probability, priors, posteriors, and maximum likelihood.
Step - 3 - Intro to Statistical Machine Learning
Learn basic machine concepts and how statistics fits in.
